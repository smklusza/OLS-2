"Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world." - Louis Pasteur

We are in a period of immense scientific innovation and growth through the industries of biotechnology and synthetic biology. However, there continues to be significant problems in accessibility to scientific tools and knowledge that can be accessed only with sufficient socioeconomic means. Scientific inventions are routinely locked behind patents and copyrights to protect intellectual property, which unfortunately excludes developing countries and people with limited means. One way to make technology available to the public is the search for expired patents in technologies which can allow said technologies to be publicly available to anyone who requests this. The Public Domain Gazette (https://publicdomaingazette.org/) is a volunteer organization spearheaded by Dr. Jenny Molloy of the University of Edinburgh to find and develop open source/public domain technologies for many initiatives, including the Open Covid Initiative in providing tools for covid-19 tests in developing countries.

The project that I wish to bring into fruition is the development of a public-domain bacterial chassis for synthetic biology utilizing only technologies that does not fall under the purview of patents, copyrights, or other forms of academic/insdustry restrictions. Some milestones for this project include:

1) Creation and validation of the public-domain synbio chassis
2) Increased participation by myself and collaborators in the Public Domain Gazette to identify additional technologies to include in future iterations of the chassis
3) Creation of novel technologies applicable to the chassis that becomes public domain upon publishing of the final materials
4) Decentralized hub of participants around the world that can efficiently distribute kits of materials for no or extremely low cost to cover costs of transit

The final vision of this project is a synthetic biology chassis that is built from the ground up under the principles of open science and public domain science for the greater goof of all human beings on this planet. Science does not belong to any system that promotes any inequality towards any person; it belongs to everybody.
